# Automation-of-Pathology


Hi Hope You are fine and healthy.
I had made this project to provide the interface for the automation of pathology where the client and the admin will have 
the one-to-one intraction for the book of the appointment of the pathology reports on their one click.
we as a team made this project for the easy and convinent for the pathology cost efficient and easy access.
In this project the whole procedure is just same as the big reputated pathology labs but we had done the little changes
to reduce the cost of the pthology report and only pay the money for the appropriate reports not for all the types of the 
other reports.

I Hope it will help you for the enhancement.
The suggestions are most welcomed.
